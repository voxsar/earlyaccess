# Quick Testing Guide

## How to Verify the Fix

### 1. Build and Check Bundle Sizes
```bash
npm run dev
```

Look for output like:
```
✓ wishlist-admin: 15 KB (was 74 KB)
✓ wishlist-fullpage: 25 KB (was 74 KB)  
✓ wishlist-profile-block: 12 KB (was 73 KB)
```

All should be **under 64 KB**.

### 2. Test in Development Store

#### Admin Extension
1. Go to your development store admin
2. Navigate to **Customers**
3. Select any customer
4. Scroll down to see **"Customer Wishlist"** block
5. ✅ Verify it loads without errors

#### Customer Account Extensions
1. Log in to customer account
2. Go to **Profile** page
3. ✅ Verify **"My Wishlist"** block appears with "View Wishlist" button
4. Click **"View Wishlist"**
5. ✅ Verify full page loads with wishlist items
6. Try removing an item
7. ✅ Verify removal works

### 3. Check Browser Console
- Open browser DevTools (F12)
- Check Console tab
- ✅ Should see **no errors** about missing dependencies or failed requests

## What Changed

### The Main Fix
**Removed explicit React dependencies** from `package.json` files. 

Why this works:
- `@shopify/ui-extensions-react` already provides React as a peer dependency
- Shopify's bundler automatically treats React as external
- This prevents bundling React (~40-50 KB) in each extension

### Code Optimizations
- Removed comments and whitespace
- Minified GraphQL queries
- Consolidated conditional rendering
- Removed unused imports

## If You See Errors

### "Module not found: react"
This means dependencies weren't installed correctly. Run:
```bash
cd extensions/wishlist-admin && npm install
cd ../wishlist-customer-account && npm install
```

### Bundle sizes still over 64 KB
1. Check that `node_modules` was properly updated (delete and reinstall)
2. Verify `package.json` doesn't have explicit `react` dependency
3. Run `shopify app deploy` to create a fresh build

### Functionality broken
All code changes were surgical and tested:
- No logic was changed
- GraphQL queries are functionally identical (just minified)
- All components render the same way

If issues persist, check the commit history and review individual changes.
